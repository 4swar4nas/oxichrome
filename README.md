## 🔍 What is oxichrome?

oxichrome is a tool designed to help create browser extensions without writing complicated code. It uses the Rust programming language, which is known for making programs that work well and are safe.

Instead of using many different coding languages, oxichrome combines everything you need into one place. Its special setup lets you build extensions that run smoothly in browsers like Chrome. The tool turns your work into WebAssembly, a fast way for browsers to run code, without you writing any JavaScript.

This means you can have powerful browser extensions that are easy to build and run safely.
